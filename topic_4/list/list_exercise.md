# Topic 2: List ADT

**Note: this document is best viewed in preview mode in VSCode (ctrl+shift+v)**. 

## Introduction
For this exercise you will implement the List ADT using C++ and a linked list. I have provided the interface for this implementation.

## Requirements:
- Do not change the interface to accommodate your coding style or solution.
- Implement it as a templated class that inherits the interface.
- Thoroughly test your program. I've included test function and cpp file for your testing procedures.
- Your solutions should be as efficient as possible but very readable.
- Use the coding conventions taught in class.

## Submission:
- Copy all files into a directory called *username_list_exercise*. Replace "username" with your Mt SAC username.
- Compress the directory using Zip, RAR, TAR, 7z, or any other program that creates a zip file
