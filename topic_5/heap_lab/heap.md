## Description

The purpose of this assignment is to achieve a better familiarity with the workings of the heap functions described in class. 

## Requirements

Implement the ArrayHeap data structure following the provided Heap interface. Then, write a priority queue which has a heap as a data member.

- Do not change the interface
- The Arrayheap should have 3 constructors
  - A constructor that takes in a comparator function as an argument
  - A constructor that takes the comparator function and an initial array size; in that order
  - A constructor that takes in a comparator function, an array to initialize it, and the array size; in that order
    - the elements of the provided array should be copied into the heap's data store
    - heapify should be run on the internal store to put it into minheap/maxheap order 
- The ArrayHeap should dynamically resize when adding an item to a full array
- The priority queue should take in the comparator function to be passed to the internal heap.
- It should provide the standard queue functions:
  - enqueue
  - dequeue
  - front
  - empty
  - clear
- Write a test program to thoroughly test your priority queue

## Submission

- Copy your .h and .cpp files to a directory called, username_heap_ex where *username* is replaced with your MtSAC username
- Compress the folder using zip, rar, tar, tar.gz, 7zip, etc.
- Submit it via canvas before the deadline
