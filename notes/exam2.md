# Exam 
Trees, Heap, Hash
No code in the written exam
2 Hours Coding
## Lab Exam
- Rewrite HashSet code, specifically probing
- Provided tree code, know how to write operations on the tree
- Provided hashmap, know how to write operations on the hashmap
- Know how to write good test at a reasonable coverage
## Trees
- Balanced trees, full trees, complete trees
- Binary trees, n-ary trees
- Node is the root of the subtree
- Root is the root of the overall tree
- Equations : 
    - number of non-leaf nodes
    - last non-leaf node
    - Number of nodes in a full tree based on the height of the tree
- Height and depth of a node
- Given drawing of a tree, show Preorder Traversal, Inorder traversal, Postorder traversal, level order traversal (BST)
- Terms Parent, children, siblings, ancestry
## Heap
- Understand the heapify function and why it exists
- Calculate the subscript of the left child and right child given the parent
- Heap is an unordered collection of values, becomes a MaxHeap or MinHeap under conditions. Know how to define these conditions
- When we speak of a heap, know it is a binary tree
- Consider other forms of heap storage other than array
- Give max heap or min heap order based on a tree
- Given an array or tree representing a heap, show the steps of what happens when a value is added
## Hash
- Hash function and data structure is a composite function (made up of two seperate functions). Know how to describe each part of those functions
- Know the different ways of dealing with collisions (at least 3 probing techniques)
- Given an array that acts as a hashtable and the hash function, add a value to the array.
