## Properties
- The number of nodes in a full binary tree of height h is: 
    - n = 2^h - 1
- Height of a full or complete binary tree having n nodes:
    - h = ceil(log(n + 1))
- The number of leaf nodes in a complete binary tree having a number of nodes n
    - n_l = floor((n+1/2))
- Number of non-leaf nodes in a complete binary tree having a number of nodes (n)
    - n_p = ceil((n-1)/2)
